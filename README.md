## plex2rekordbox

Utility for exporting playlists from Plex into Rekrdbox, with support for audio file format conversion.

## TODO / Ideas

- Make more configurable 
- Fork plex client and add list playlist method so we can select playlists
- CLI 
- Option to only export tracks to location rather than create a whole playlist (useful just for importing music to DJ dir)
- Download progress bar 
- Remove flacs once processed
