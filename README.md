## plex2rekordbox

Utility for exporting playlists from Plex into Rekordbox. Outputs M3u files which can be imported to Rekordbox. 

Currently expects all input files to be flacs, and converts all output files to MP3.

## TODO / Ideas
- Option to only export tracks to location rather than create a whole playlist (useful just for importing music to DJ dir)
- TUI w/ nice to haves (e.g download progress bar)
- Make exported file format configurable
